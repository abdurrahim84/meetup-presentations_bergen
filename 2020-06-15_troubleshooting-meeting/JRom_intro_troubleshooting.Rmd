# PROGRAMMING BASICS

![](computer_parts.jpg)

???

The computer is made of many parts and nowadays, we do not need to know about
all of them, but three parts are essential to know about.

---

# PROGRAMMING BASICS

![](computer_parts2.jpg)

???

First - **the memory**, also known as RAM. This is where all the stuff sits
when we're working on our computer. Every program, in order to work, must
be read into memory. Nowadays, computers tend to have quite large RAM, so
usually we don't need to worry about optimizing our code to fit in the memory,
but we need to remember that all the data takes space and the variables that
we create take space, and the operations that we envoke need space, perhaps
sometimes double of the one that the input data require. Thus, often, when
the code just hangs, it might be as simple as running out of memory.

---

???

Then - we have **the CPU**, which is the executive mode of the computer. It
takes data from RAM, performs a certain operation and spits the result out also
into memory. Nowadays, we have actually more than one computing node on our
CPU - called _cores_, which again might split the calculations into several
_threads_.

Thus, CPU communicates only with RAM and this communication is quite fast.

---

???

What can be slow is **disk operations**. The disk, or hard drive, stores data
and, in contrast to RAM, does not need energy to keep the data. It is much
bigger than the memory, but also much slower. All the data before making use of
it, needs to be read into the memory, and then usually write to disk after
calculations. One type of error that might occur is when we run out of space on
the disk, or we do not have permissions to write to a specific part of the disk.

---

# PROGRAMMING BASICS

Successful program - requirements:

- _enough memory_
- _all variables present_
- _enough disk space_
- _permission to read/write_

# R BASICS


???

Now that we know what a program needs in general, let's focus on some
specific points for R code.

---

```{r,eval=FALSE}
this.variable.has <- "value"

this.is.result.of <- function( argument ){
  #function body
  return( "a result" )
}
```

???

R is smart and it does much for us in the background, but we need to be
aware of that when we code.

The first line of code takes the string and *assigns it* to a variable. This
is actually three operations:

- create a variable and set its type to "character"
- block enough memory to hold the string
- take the address of the memory and point it to the variable

When we see the arrow in assigning, it may help us remember that what R does
is that it actually assigns the memory address to the variable - it creates
*pointers* in the background.

Next, there is a function. A function describes what will happen with variables
when we envoke it. A function can have *arguments* and can return *results*.

--

- functional programming
- variables are *pointers*

???

Even though there exist classes and objects in R, it is a *functional programming language*
because we do not need to operate on objects and classes.

And, as I've mentioned, variables are actually pointers to a memory address.
Let's see why it is important to understand.

--

```{r}
a <- 1
b <- a #<<
a <- a + 1
a
```

*What is the value of b?*

???

First, we assign `1` to `a`, then we assign `a` to `b`, then we add `1` to
the value of `a` and we can see that `a` now points to `2`, which is
expected. So what is the value of `b`?

--

...let's check

```{r}
b #<<
```

**copying on demand**

???

That's another trick of R - whenever two variables point to one value and one of
the variables changes, a copy of the value is created so that the other, unchanged,
variable points still to the unchanged value. This process is called *copy on demand*.

---

# R BASICS
## Environment

???

There are many other aspects of R that we will not talk about, but one of the
most important is *environment*.

---

```{r}
a <- 1
my_fun <- function( a ){
  d <- 2
  a <- d + a
  return( a )
}
my_fun( a )
```

*What is the value of `a` now?*

???

Let's consider another piece of code. First, we assign a value to `a`. Next,
we write a function that also uses `a` as a variable name, and finally, we
call this function using our variable as the argument. As expected, the
result of the function is `r my_fun( a )`. But has `a` changed?

--

```{r}
a #<<
```

**Each function has its own environment!**

*"Environment is like a bag of names."*

Read more in *"Advanced R"* by Hadley Wickham https://adv-r.hadley.nz/

???

There is one environment that holds all the other environments - called
*global environment*.

OK, but what if we actually want to change the value of the variable in the
global environment?

---

## Environment - ctd.

*Super assignment:* assign a value in the parent environment

```{r}
my_fun2 <- function( a ){
  d <- 2
  a <<- d + a
  return( a )
}
my_fun2( a ) #<<
a #<<
```

**NOTE:** this can be dangerous!

---

## Environment - ctd.

```{r}
my_fun <- function( a ){
  d <- 2 #<<
  a <- d + a
  return( a )
}
```

*What is the value of `d` outside the function?*

--

```{r,error=TRUE}
d #<<
```

???

`d` exists only in the function's environment!

This is important when writing the functions and also when knitting an .Rmd file!

# CAUSE OF ERROR

---

## Useful functions

- `base::traceback`

    - envoke right after the error!
    
- `base::browser`

    - use in a program to peek into environment content

- from the `rlang` package: `last_error`, `last_trace`, and `trace_back`

    - often more informative than the `base` version
