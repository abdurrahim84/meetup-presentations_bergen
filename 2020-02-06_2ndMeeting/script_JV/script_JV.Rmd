dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges:

mutate() adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
select() picks variables based on their names.
filter() picks cases based on their values.
summarise() reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
arrange() changes the ordering of the rows.
sample_n() and sample_frac() to take random samples.
