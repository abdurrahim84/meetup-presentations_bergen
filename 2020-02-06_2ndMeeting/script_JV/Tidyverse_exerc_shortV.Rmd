# Tidy data

Data comes in many formats but R prefers just one: _tidy data_.

A data set is tidy if and only if:

1. Every variable is in its own column
2. Every observation is in its own row
3. Every value is in its own cell

## We begin with a toy dataset


```{r}

cases <- tribble(
  ~Country, ~"2011", ~"2012", ~"2013",
      "FR",    7000,    6900,    7000,
      "DE",    5800,    6000,    6200,
      "US",   15000,   14000,   13000
)

pollution <- tribble(
       ~city,   ~size, ~amount,
  "New York", "large",      23,
  "New York", "small",      14,
    "London", "large",      22,
    "London", "small",      16,
   "Beijing", "large",     121,
   "Beijing", "small",     56
)

```


## Tidy and untidy data

We begin with `table1` from the gapminder dataset. `table1` is tidy:
```{r}
table1 
```

It's tidy because:
* Each variable has its own column
* Each observation has its own row
* Each value has its own cell


It's easy to manipulate tidy data. Here we add a rate column with `mutate()`:
```{r}
table1 %>%
  mutate(rate = cases/population)
```

Is `table2` tidy?
```{r}
table2
```

Consider the count column. Untidy data makes it very hard to manipulate.

## Your Turn 1

On a sheet of paper, draw how the cases data set would look if it had the same values grouped into three columns: **country**, **year**, **n** 

Discuss with your neighbor.

 
## Tidy verbs include: 
`pivot_longer()`  to make data longer 
`pivot_wider()`   to make data wider
`separate()`      to split a column
`separate_rows()` to separate rows
`unite()`         to unite columns

## Your Turn 2

Use `pivot_longer()` to reorganize `table4a` into three columns: **country**, **year**, and **cases**.

```{r}
table4a %>%
 pivot_longer(-country, names_to = "year", 
    values_to = "cases") 
```

## Your Turn 3

On a sheet of paper, draw how the pollution data set would look if it had the same values grouped into three columns: **city**, **large**, **small**

Discuss with your neighbor.


## Your Turn 4

Use `pivot_wider()` to reorganize `table2` into four columns: **country**, **year**, **cases**, and **population**.

```{r}
table2 %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = count)
```


# Transforming data with dplyr

Dplyr gives you three _general_ functions for manipulating data: `mutate()`, `summarise()`, and `group_by()`. These may be augmented these with functions from the packages below, which focus on specific types of data.

Package   | Data Type
--------- | --------
forcats   | factors
stringr   | strings
hms       | times
lubridate | dates and times


# Babynames

```{r}
babynames
print(babynames) 
```

## Using skimr to view the data 

```{r}
skim(babynames)
my_skim <- skim_with(numeric = sfl(p25 = NULL, p75=NULL))
my_skim(babynames)
```

skim_with() is a closure: a function that returns a new function. This lets you have several skimming functions in a single R session, but it also means that you need to assign the return of skim_with() before you can use it.

# Mastering dplyr verbs

## Select

Proportion of names
```{r}
select(babynames)
```

## Your Turn 5

Alter the code to select just the `n` column:

```{r}
select(babynames,   )
```


## Filter

Girls named `Mary`

```{r}
filter(babynames,  )
```

## Your Turn 6

Show:

* All of the names where prop is greater than or equal to 0.08  
* All of the children named "Sea"  
* All of the names that have a missing value for `n`  

```{r}
filter(babynames,  )
filter(babynames,  )
filter(babynames,  )
```

## Your Turn 7

Use Boolean operators to alter the code below to return only the rows that contain:

* Girls named Sea  

```{r}
filter(babynames, )
```

## Arrange

Arrange names by usage in dataset
```{r}
arrange(babynames,  )
```

## Your Turn 8

Arrange babynames by `n`. Add `prop` as a second (tie breaking) variable to arrange on. Can you tell what the smallest value of `n` is?

```{r}
arrange(babynames,  )
```

## desc

```{r}
arrange(babynames,  )
```

## Your Turn 9

Use `desc()` to find the names with the highest prop.

```{r}
arrange(babynames,  )
```

## Steps and *the pipe*

```{r}
babynames %>%
  filter(year == 2015, sex == "M") %>%
  select(name, n) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

## Your Turn 10

Use `%>%` to write a sequence of functions that: 

1. Filter babynames to just the girls that were born in 2015  
2. Select the `name` and `n` columns  
3. Arrange the results so that the most popular names are near the top.

```{r}
babynames 
  
```

## Your Turn 12 (*)

Use summarise() to compute three statistics about the data:

1. The first (minimum) year in the dataset  
2. The last (maximum) year in the dataset  
3. The total number of children represented in the data

```{r}
babynames 
  
```


# Toy dataset for transforming data with dplyr

```{r}

pollution <- tribble(
       ~city,   ~size, ~amount, 
  "New York", "large",       23,
  "New York", "small",       14,
    "London", "large",       22,
    "London", "small",       16,
   "Beijing", "large",      121,
   "Beijing", "small",       56
)
```

## Summarize

```{r}
pollution 

```

We introduce `group_by` to pull the cities together. Find the mean, sum and n. 
```{r}
pollution 
  
```

## Your Turn 14

Use `group_by()`, `summarise()`, and `arrange()` to display the ten most popular baby names. Compute popularity as the total number of children of a single gender given a name.

```{r}
babynames %>%
  group_by(name, sex) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(n)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total))
```


## Ungroup

```{r}
babynames %>%
  group_by(name, sex) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(n)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total))
```

## Mutate

Make a new column with the percent of the proportion rounded to 2 decimal figures.
```{r}
babynames 
  
```

## Your Turn 16

Use `min_rank()` and `mutate()` to rank each row in `babynames` from largest `n` to lowest `n`.

```{r}
babynames 
 
```

# Joining data

## Practicing with toy dataset

```{r}
band <- tribble(
   ~name,     ~band,
  "Mick",  "Stones",
  "John", "Beatles",
  "Paul", "Beatles"
)

instrument <- tribble(
    ~name,   ~plays,
   "John", "guitar",
   "Paul",   "bass",
  "Keith", "guitar"
)

instrument2 <- tribble(
    ~artist,   ~plays,
   "John", "guitar",
   "Paul",   "bass",
  "Keith", "guitar"
)
```

## Mutating joins

## Types of joins

```{r}
band %>% left_join(instrument, by = "name")
band %>% right_join(instrument, by = "name")
band %>% full_join(instrument, by = "name")
band %>% inner_join(instrument, by = "name")

```
## Working with different names of variable columns. Just tell dplyr which two variables are alike.

```{r}
band %>% left_join(instrument2, by = c("name" = "artist"))
```

## Filtering joins

What is the same/different between the two datasets?

```{r}
band %>% semi_join(instrument, by = "name")
band %>% anti_join(instrument, by = "name")
```


## Now with flight data

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(lubridate)
```

## Flights data
```{r}
flights
skim(flights)
```

## Your Turn 18

Which airlines had the largest arrival delays?  Work in groups to complete the code below.

1. Use `drop_na` to eliminate NA 
2. Join `airlines` to `flights`
3. Compute and order the average arrival delays by airline. Display full names, no codes.


```{r}
flights %>% 
  drop_na(arr_delay) %>%
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay)) %>%
  arrange(delay)
```      


# Working with character strings 

Predict what these might return:

```{r}
strings <- c("Apple", "Pineapple", "Orange")

str_detect(strings, pattern = "pp")
str_detect(strings, pattern =  "apple")
str_detect(strings, pattern = "[Aa]pple")
```


# Finally getting to ggplot2 - Yea!

* Start with `ggplot()`
* Supply a dataset and aesthetic mapping (with `aes()`)
* Add on layers (like `geom_point()` or `geom_histogram()`)
* Add on scales (like `scale_colour_brewer()`)
* Add on faceting specifications (like `facet_wrap()`)
* Add on coordinate systems (like `coord_flip`)


## Start with Bechdel test data

This data on movies and [the Bechdel test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test) was collected by the website FiveThirtyEight. The Bechdel test is a measure of the representation of women in fiction. It asks whether a work features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man. 

Preview the data. 

```{r}
bechdel
```

## Consider
What relationship do you expect to see between movie budget (budget) and domestic gross(domgross)?

## Your Turn 25

Run the code in the chunk to make a graph. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = bechdel) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = budget, y = domgross))
```

## Your Turn 26

Add `color`, `size`, `alpha`, and `shape` aesthetics to your graph. Experiment.  

```{r}
ggplot(data = bechdel) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = budget, y = domgross, color=clean_test))

ggplot(bechdel) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = budget, y = domgross, size=clean_test))
ggplot(bechdel) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = budget, y = domgross, shape=clean_test))
ggplot(bechdel) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = budget, y = domgross, alpha=clean_test))

```

## Declaring the color outside of the aes mapping

```{r}
ggplot(bechdel) + 
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = budget, y = domgross), color="blue")
```

## Your Turn 27

Replace this scatterplot with one that draws boxplots. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = bechdel) + geom_point(aes(x = clean_test, y = budget), color = "dark green")

ggplot(data = bechdel) 
```

## Your Turn 28

Make a histogram of the `budget` variable from `bechdel`.

```{r}
ggplot(bechdel)  
  
```

## Your Turn 29
Try to find a better binwidth for `budget`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = bechdel) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = budget), binwidth= )
```

## Your Turn 30

Make a density plot of `budget` and then one colored by `clean_test`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = bechdel) 
  

ggplot(data = bechdel) 
  
```


## Your Turn 31

Make a barchart of `clean_test` colored by `clean_test`.

```{r}
ggplot(data=bechdel) 
 
```



## Your Turn 33

Save the last plot. Note ggsave with save your plots with custom size in inches.

```{r}
ggsave("my-plot.png")
ggsave("my-plot.pdf", width = 6, height = 6)

```


# Data types(*)

What kind of object is the `marital` variable?  

```{r}
gss_cat
```

* Factors are R's way of storing categorical data.
* They have a set of allowable values called **levels**.
* Internally they are stored as integers.


Using the data `gss_cat`, find the average hours of tv watched (`tvhours`) for each category of marital status (`marital`).

```{r}
gss_cat 
 
```

Is this likely?

## Your Turn 21

Fix your summary of average hours of tv watched (`tvhours`) by marital status (`marital`), to drop missing values in `tvhours`, then create a plot to examine the results.

```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  drop_na(tvhours) %>%
  group_by(marital) %>% 
  summarise(avg_tvhours = mean(tvhours)) %>%
  ggplot() 
    

```

## Your Turn 22

Explore the average hours of tv watched by religion.

```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  drop_na(tvhours) %>%
  group_by(relig) %>%
  summarise(avg_tvhours = mean(tvhours)) %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = avg_tvhours, 
      y = fct_reorder(relig, avg_tvhours)))
```

# Quiz 

Why is this plot not very useful?

```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  drop_na(tvhours) %>%
  group_by(denom) %>%
  summarise(avg_tvhours = mean(tvhours)) %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = avg_tvhours,
      y = fct_reorder(denom, avg_tvhours)))
```

There are too many categories, and the categories are poorly labelled.

## Your Turn 23

Edit the code to also relabel some other Baptist denominations:

* "Baptist-dk which"    
* "Other baptists"  

```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(denom = fct_recode(denom,
    "Baptist - Southern" = "Southern baptist",
    "Baptist - Don't know" = "Baptist-dk which",
    "Baptist - Other" = "Other baptists")
  ) %>%
  pull(denom) %>%
  levels()
```

## Your Turn 24

What does the function `detect_denom()` do?

```{r}
detect_denom <- function(x){
  case_when(
    str_detect(x, "[Bb]ap") ~ "Baptist", 
    str_detect(x, "[Pp]res") ~ "Presbyterian",
    str_detect(x, "[Ll]uth") ~ "Lutheran",
    str_detect(x, "[Mm]eth") ~ "Methodist",
    TRUE ~ x
  )
}

gss_cat %>% pull(denom) %>% levels() %>% detect_denom()
```

It tries to detect a higher level grouping by looking for patterns in the denomination strings.

This is ideal for combining with `fct_revel()`:
```{r}
gss_cat %>%
  drop_na(tvhours) %>%
  mutate(denom_higher = fct_relabel(denom, detect_denom) %>%
      fct_reorder(tvhours, mean)) %>%
  group_by(denom_higher, denom) %>%
  summarise(avg_tvhours = mean(tvhours)) %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = avg_tvhours,
      y = denom_higher)) 
```

# Take aways

* Extract variables with `select()`  
* Extract cases with `filter()`  
* Arrange cases, with `arrange()`  

* Make tables of summaries with `summarise()`  
* Make new variables, with `mutate()`  
* Do groupwise operations with `group_by()`

* Connect operations with `%>%`  

* Use `left_join()`, `right_join()`, `full_join()`, or `inner_join()` to join datasets
* Use `semi_join()` or `anti_join()` to filter datasets against each other
